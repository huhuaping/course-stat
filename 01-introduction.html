## 信念偏见诅咒 

**信念偏见效应**：如果你让人们决定一个特定的论点是否在逻辑上是有效的，我们往往会受到结论可信度的影响，即使我们不应该这样做。

这是一个有效的**论据**，其**结论**是可信的：：

- 没有香烟很便宜（前提1）

- 有些令人上瘾的东西很便宜（前提2）

- 因此，有些令人上瘾的东西不是香烟（结论）

这是一个有效的**论据**，但其**结论**是不可信的：

- 没有令人上瘾的东西很便宜（前提1）

- 有些香烟很便宜（前提2）

- 因此，有些香烟不会上瘾（结论）

## 信念偏见诅咒：持枪和控枪的美国现象

**素材1**：

- 美国宪法规定，人民持有和携带武器的权利不受侵犯，这是宪法权利。美国历史上地广人稀，一旦发生暴力事件，警察没办法及时赶到现场，所以美国人民应该有枪支自卫。

**观点**：

A. 宪法很大程度考虑到了公民个人私人持枪的选择权

B. 菜刀在坏人手里会成为凶器，私人持枪以保护自己和身边的人不受侵害也同样重要

C. 其他观点


---
## 信念偏见诅咒：持枪和控枪的美国现象

**素材2**：

- 1968年美国人口2亿，拥有枪支1.1亿；今天美国人口3.2亿，拥有枪支3.6亿！50年前是两人一支，现在是几乎一人一支。

- 2016年美国枪支产业雇佣了30多万人，对美国经济的贡献是500亿。美国枪支市场巨大，提供了几十万个工作机会，也养活了很多利益集团，他们不答应禁枪等等。


**观点**：

A. 军火产业虽然提供了一些就业，但也助长了枪击事件的发生

B. 军火市场根深蒂固，进而让私人禁枪的提案或修宪变得困难

C. 其他观点

---
## 信念偏见诅咒：持枪和控枪的美国现象

**素材3**：

- 美国有三亿多支枪，每年被枪杀的人3万多。2014年美国有4万人自杀，其中超过一半选择用枪；70岁以上自杀的老人，选择用枪的比例最高，74%。

- 美国虽然总发生枪击案，但发生的概率仅有千分之0.1。过去23年美国枪杀案的比例整整下降了1倍！

**观点**：

A. 枪击事件很大程度上是因为影响恶劣而被社会过度关注和解读

B. 引发死亡率的主因很多，私人持枪造成的社会伤害并没有愈演愈烈

C. 其他观点

---
## 信念偏见诅咒：持枪和控枪的美国现象

**素材4**：

- 美国枪支管理法律不是越来越严，而是越来越松。

- 正反观点针锋相对：“美国游泳淹死的人是5倍于被枪走火打死的”。“我亲戚三岁的小姑娘被他爸枪走火打死。如果这个小孩是你的，你愿意她成为你玩枪的社会成本吗？”

- 如果不发生这次拉斯维加斯枪击案，美国又会出台一个放宽枪支管制的议案，要讨论允许私人购买枪支消声器的议案，就是可以公开卖无声枪了。在美国，要自杀的人没枪也会用别的方式死，美国人对死亡的观念：毒药、安乐死与尊严

**观点**：

A. 控枪政策日趋放松尽管有其可解释之处，但并不是长远明智之举

B. 持枪派，控枪派和中立派或许都无可厚非，各方相互制衡最为重要

C. 其他观点

## 统计学的方法论

用**样本**.red[描述]或.red[推断]**总体**。**概率论**在其中发挥着重要作用，也是方法论的分水岭。

&lt;img src="pic/chpt01-stat-methology.png" width="1855" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## 描述性统计(descriptive statistics)

- **定义**：研究数据收集、处理、汇总、图表描述、概括与分析等统计方法 

- **内容**：
    - 搜集数据
    - 整理数据
    - 展示数据
    - 描述性分析

- **目的**：描述数据特征；找出数据的基本规律

---
## 推断性统计(inferential statistics)

- **定义**：研究如何利用样本数据来推断总体特征的统计方法

- **内容**：
    - 参数估计
    - 假设检验

- **目的**：对总体特征作出推断

## 总体和样本

**总体(population)**：

- **定义**：所研究的全部个体(数据) 的集合，其中的每一个个体也称为元素

- **分类**：分为有限总体和无限总体

    - 有限总体的范围能够明确确定，且元素的数目是有限的
    - 无限总体所包括的元素是无限的，不可数的

**样本 (sample)**

- **定义**：从总体中抽取的一部分元素的集合

- **样本容量**：构成样本的元素的数目称为样本容量或样本量 (sample size)

---
## 参数和统计量

**参数(parameter)**:

- **定义**：描述总体特征的概括性数字度量，是研究者想要了解的总体的某种特征值

- **重要统计量**：所关心的参数主要有总体均值(
`\(\mu\)`)、方差(
`\(\sigma^2\)`) 等

- **记号**：总体参数通常用希腊字母表示
`\(\mu,\sigma^2,\Phi,\gamma,\cdots\)`

**统计量(statistic)**:

- **定义**：用来描述样本特征的概括性数字度量，它是根据样本数据计算出来的一些量，是样本的函数

- **重要统计量**：所关心的样本统计量有样本均值(
`\(\bar{x}\)`)、样本方差(
`\(s^2\)`) 等

- **记号**：样本统计量通常用小写英文字母来表示
`\(\bar{x},s^2,w,v,\cdots\)`

- 取值只用于区分所属类别的定性数据。

- 对事物进行分类的结果，数据表现为类别，一般用文字来表述。

    - 例如，性别(男、女）和婚姻状况(已婚、未婚、离婚、分居）之类的变量。

## 序数数据(ordinal data)

- 变量的不同取值有顺序差异，即存在自然顺序

- 变量的不同取值的差值，没有实际意义

    - 五分量表、无差异曲线

&lt;img src="pic/ordinal-show.png" width="753" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## 序数数据(ordinal data)

无差异曲线：

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="pic/ordinal-show2.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

]

---

## 区间数据( interval data) ：

区间数据( interval data) 的数值存在自然顺序、可以比较大小（加减）、但乘除比率没有意义。

- 变量的不同取值有顺序差异，即存在自然顺序

- 变量的不同取值的差值，也具有实际意义

- 但不同取值的比率是没有实际意义的

--
    - 两个时期之内的距离(如2000 – 1995) 是有意义的，但两个时期的比率(2000/1995) 就没有什么意义。

--
    - 2013年8 月11 日上午11 点天气预报说杨凌的温度是华氏60 度，而长沙达到华氏90 度。长沙比杨凌温度高30华氏度(90-60)，是可以的。但说长沙比杨凌暖和1.5倍(90/60)，是没有意义。

---
## 比率数据(ratio data)：

比率数据(ratio data)的取值存在自然顺序、可以比较大小（加减）、乘除比率有实际意义。

- 变量存在真实“零点”

- 变量的不同取值存在自然顺序（
`\(X_2 \leq X_1\)`或
`\(X_2 \geq X_1\)`）

- 变量的不同取值之差是有实际意义的(
`\(X_2-X_1\)`) 

- 变量的不同取值的乘除都是有意义的（
`\(X_1/X_2\)`）

    - 如：GDP(亿元)、个人收入(元)等

# 数据的时间状态

---

## Type1：时间序列数据(time series data)：

**时间序列数据**：对一个变量在不同时间取值的一组观测结果。按取值间隔可分为**高频数据**和**低频数据**。

--

- 实时牌价：如股票价格

- 每日(daily）：如天气预报

- 每周(weekly）：如货币供给数字

--

- 每月(monthly）：如失业率和消费者价格指数

- 每季度(quarterly）：如GDP

- 每年(annually）：如政府预算

- 每5 年(quinquennially）：如制造业普查资料

- 每10 年( decennially）：如人口普查资料

---

## Type1：时间序列数据(time series data)：

平稳性(stationary)：如果一个时间序列的均值和方差不随时间而系统地变化，那它就是平稳的(stationary) 。

&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="pic/chpt01-1-data-series-M1.png" alt="1951年1月-1999年9月美国的M1货币供给" width="529" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;1951年1月-1999年9月美国的M1货币供给&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---
## Type2：截面数据(cross-section data)：

横截面数据：对一个或多个变量在同一时间点上收集的数据

异质性(heterogeneity) ：当我们的统计分析包含有异质的单位时，我们必须考虑尺度(size)或规模效应(scale effect) 以避免造成混乱。

## Type3：面板数据(Panel Data)

**面板数据**：是兼有时间序列和横截面数据两种成份，指对相同的横截面单元在时间轴上进行跟踪调查的数据。

- 平衡面板(balanced panel)：所有截面单元都具有相同的观测次数

- 非平衡面板(unbalanced panel)：并非所有截面单元都具有相同的观测次数

**数据点**（观测数）
`\(n\)`：

- 数据点（观测数）=截面单元数*时期数，也即：
`\(n=q\ast t\)`。

可能存在的问题：

- “平稳性”问题：

- “异方差”问题：
